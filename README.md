machine learning project
sources used are tensorflow.org and youtube.com/tensorflow

When I started this project I did a lot of research and utilized some code from the tutorials at tensorflow.org and from the tensorflow youtube channel at youtube.com/tensorflow.
The amount of neural network layers I have at the moment is two. Unfortunately it is a bit of a work in progress at the moment as I am short on time. I used one hot encoding to transform the categorical input data into more columns that each have either a one or zero depending on if they belong to that group. I plan on using the cross validation strategy to test at the end of  training subsets of data to test how accurate the model is from data that it has never seen before. I need to improve my network to make it functional. I think that experimenting with the optimization function and the amount of layers will increase accuracy.
